Files:

Phenotypes
1) Pheno1.rds: A .rds file with the BLUEs for the evaluated genotypes in one single location. This data was used to run our single location model analysis.
2) Pheno2.rds: A .rds file with BLUEs og the genotypes per location. This data was used for our multi-location analysis.

.R Codes:
1) .R file to run Single location model analysis
2) .R file to run Multi-location model analysis
3) .R file to run simulation scenarios
