# Mixture Mixed Models: Biennial Growth as a Latent Variable in Coffee Bean Progenies

Statistical analysis of Coffea arabica L. progeny production has been a great challenge.
In this species, genotypes may present differential biennial behaviors due to different physiological responses to the environmental conditions,
indicating a mixture of two subpopulations in the tested progenies. Previously proposed statistical methods are unable to handle data overdispersion 
and/or bimodality because they assume the same stochastic process generating different phenotypes. On this study we propose a finite mixture mixed model for
modeling the biennial patterns and shows the advantage of our method using simulated and real data sets, we also extended the model to handle Multi-environmnent trial data anaylsis 
using unstructured (co)variance matrices for genotypic and residual effects. All those methods are compiled in a R package MMix.
